### OpenGL Virtual Scene Project
**ðŸ’­ The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of OpenGL concepts**  

This includes: 
  - Loading OBJ objects
  - Working with MVP matrices
  - Applying textures and lighting
  - Creating a skybox
  - Adding animations
  - Using alpha blending
  - Utilizing multiple textures such as bump maps, specular maps, and alpha maps.

The virtual scene showcases at least 10 instances of objects, crafted with a variety of shapes and unique model matrices for each. To enhance interactivity and realism, the scene is equipped with a first-person perspective (FPS) camera. Animations further enhance the dynamic nature of the environment.

This project combines advanced rendering techniques with OpenGL's multi-texturing capabilities to achieve high-quality visuals and demonstrate the versatility of OpenGL in creating rich, dynamic virtual worlds.
